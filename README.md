# DTC Project on Covid-19 Unemployment.


This research was done by a group of 5 students at Seattle University on the effects of Covid-19 on Unemployment. Each questions was broken down into three different branches in R. 

(1st Question: Jill & Jomaica, 2nd Question: Taylor, 3rd Question: Erik & Kristen)

During the course of this research, we examined how the retail sector and the economy have been affected by COVID-19. We will highlight the results from our study based on the three questions below. The variables used for each  question is under the README file - Q1_README, Q2_README, Q3_README.

(Our finished code is in the folder: Code > Working Files folder) and our final analysis is located in the Code folder in an RMarkdown file named Final-Analysis.html).


1.  How has COVID affected the health of the retail industry, as measured by employment?
2.  How has retail fared relative to other industries?
3. Retail needs to worry about who has money to spend - what has changed about who is working and earning money?
